Kindly write python codes for the following statements using functions from Pandas Library and submit a single Colab file link by 1 pm.
1. Create a Series of 10 elements and change their default index from numeric to alphabets starting from 'a'.
2. Create a series of the following batting averages with batsmen name as the key. Name the index as Batsmen and value as Batting Average.
(Rohit: 152, Shikhar: 102, Virat: 170, Shreyas: 95, Rishabh: 125, Hardik: 112, Ravindra: 88, Bhuvaneshwar: 75, Kuldeep: 67, Shami: 59, Bumrah: 12)
Perform the following operations on the Series created.
(a) Display the list of Batsmen with more than 100 as batting average
(b) Display the list of Batsmen with less than 90 as batting average
(c) Due to the good performance of the top six batsmen, increase their average by 25%
(d) Due to the poor performance of the bottom three batsmen, decrease their average by 10%
(e) Include a 12th man named 'Chahal' in the list without any batting average and display the new list
(f) Display how many batting averages are NULL in the list
(g) Display how many batting averages are NOT NULL in the list 
(h) Due to injury to Shikhar, he was replaced by "Rahul" having a batting average of 120. Change that in the series and display the new series.
3. Create another series of bowling average of the same team having the following averages.
(Rohit: 102, Shikhar: 100, Virat: 121, Shreyas: 112, Rishabh: 100, Hardik: 42, Ravindra: 41, Bhuvaneshwar: 32, Kuldeep: 36, Shami: 27, Bumrah: 19)
(a) Find out the ratio of the batting/bowling average for the two series
(b) Find out the difference of the batting & bowling average for the two series
(c) Display the players having the ratio of the two averages of more than 1.5
4. Create a dataframe of 10 students for their complete graduation (3 years) with 3 columns - Name, Year, Percentage 
e.g. (Ram, 2017, 75), (Ram, 2018, 77), (Ram, 2019, 80), (Reeta, 2017, 83), (Reeta, 2018, 89), (Reeta, 2019, 85), etc. (This will make 30 entries in the dataframe for the 10 students across 3 years [2017-2018-2019])
Perform the following operations.
(a) Display the first 8 entries of the dataframe
(b) Display the last 5 entries of the dataframe
(c) Change the index values of the dataframe with numbers written as text. e.g. 1 replaced as One, 2 replaced as Two, etc.
(d) Add a grade column with no values
(e) Display the student details only for the year 2018
(f) Display the student details having more than 75% marks in any year
(g) Find the transpose of the dataframe
