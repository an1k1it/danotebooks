Kindly write python codes for the following statements using functions from Pandas Library and submit a single Colab file link by 1 pm.
1. Create a series of size 20 with random elements in any range and perform the following operations
(a) Change the index from 'a' to 't'
(b) Assign the values of 4th and 5th element of the series at 'm' and 'n' index position
(c) Assign 10 value to the last 3 elements of the series
(d) Display the series values from index 'e' to 'r'
(e) Using loc function, display first 10 elements of series
(f) Using iloc function, display last 10 elements of series
(g) Sort the values of the series
2. Create two dataframes - First having 4 rows and 4 columns and Second with 3 rows and 4 columns, with random data values of your choice, and perform following operations
(a) Perform additions of the two dataframes
(b) Perform difference of the two dataframes
(c) Change the diagonal values in the first dataframe to NaN and then perform addition and substraction of the two dataframes 
(d) While adding the two dataframes, fill 100 in place of Nan values.
(e) Perform Division of two dataframes
(f) Write a function to print difference between highest and lowest values of each column of both the dataframes
(g) Write a function to print difference between highest and lowest values of each row of both the dataframes
(h) Sort the index of both the dataframes columnwise and row-wise
(i) Sort the values of both the dataframes column-wise and row-wise
(j) Find the rank of elements in 2nd column of both the dataframes
